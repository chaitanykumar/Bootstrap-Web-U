      <p class="card-text">What is the concept of innovation
        <br>
        Innovation is a process by which a domain, a product, or a service is renewed and brought up to date by applying
        new processes,
        introducing new techniques, or establishing successful ideas to create new value.
        The creation of value is a defining characteristic of innovation.
      </p>
      <p>What is the aim of innovation
        <br>
        The purpose of innovation is to come up with new ideas and technologies that increase productivity and generate
        greater output and value with the same input.
        According to the aforementioned Stanford study,
        innovation has been responsible for up to 85% of all economic growth.
      </p>

      <p>Where does innovation start
        <br>
        Innovation: Where Do Ideas Come From - Ezassi
        Ultimately, innovation comes from a combination of internal and external sources. According to Incremental
        Innovation, here are the most important sources of innovation: Customers (accounts for 50% of all innovative
        ideas) Marketing and sales department.

      <p>1. Innovation Helps Companies Grow
        <br>
        As mentioned above, if you want to grow your business in order to become more successful and profitable,
        there are a few ways that you can go about achieving that goal.
        Though it will be a slow path forward, you might choose to plod along your current path,
        growing incrementally as you perfect your existing products and business models. Instead, you might choose to
        grow your business by merging or acquiring others,
        which is faster, but also typically a much more expensive avenue for growth.
        Or you might choose to evolve by rethinking your product or business model—or both—from the ground up,
        which is a process that can lead to rapid expansion and allow you to scale your business very quickly.
        This potential for growth is likely the reason that, in a recent survey conducted by The Boston Consulting
        Group,
        79 percent of surveyed executives claimed innovation ranked among their top three business initiatives—the
        highest percentage since the survey began almost a decade ago. Furthermore,
        the BCG notes that organizations consistently earning high rankings in the annual “top 50 most innovative
        companies” all have a common focus on science, technology, and development.
        These companies continue to grow while staying one step ahead of the competition because they value the positive
        impact of innovation.
